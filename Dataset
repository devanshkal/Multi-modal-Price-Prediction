The dataset is organized into two primary files for a typical machine learning workflow: train.csv and test.csv.

The training file, train.csv, is comprehensive, containing all the data required to develop a predictive model. It features four columns:
1. sample_id: A unique identifier for each product record.
2. catalog_content: The descriptive text detailing the product (e.g., title, features).
3. image_link: A URL or path to the product's associated image.
4. price: The target variable for the prediction task, which the model is intended to learn.

The testing file, test.csv, is used for evaluation and holds only the input features necessary for making predictions on unseen data. It contains the first three columns: sample_id, catalog_content, and image_link. The price column is deliberately excluded, as its values are what the trained model must predict.
